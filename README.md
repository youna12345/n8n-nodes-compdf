# n8n-nodes-compdf

This is an n8n community node that integrates [ComPDF API](https://api.compdf.com/) into your n8n workflows, enabling async document processing including PDF conversion, intelligent document extraction, PDF merging, splitting, compression, and more.

[ComPDF](https://www.compdf.com/) provides powerful document processing APIs that support PDF conversion, OCR, document comparison, intelligent extraction, and many other document operations.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/) workflow automation platform.

## Credentials

To use this node, you need a **ComPDF API Key**.

1. Sign up at [ComPDF API](https://api.compdf.com/signup)
2. After registration, navigate to the API dashboard to obtain your **Public API Key**
3. In n8n, go to **Credentials** > **New Credential** > search for **ComPDF API**
4. Paste your API Key and save

## Compatibility

- Tested with n8n v2.10.3+
- Requires Node.js 18+

## Usage

All file processing operations in this node use the **async processing** pattern:

1. **Submit a task** — Use any file processing operation (e.g., PDF to Word) to upload a file. The API returns a `taskId`.
2. **Poll for results** — Use the **Get Task Information** operation with the `taskId` to check the processing status.

### Example Workflow

1. Add a **ComPDF** node with operation **PDF to Word**
2. Connect it to a source that provides a binary file (e.g., HTTP Request or Read Binary File)
3. The node returns a `taskId` in the output
4. Add another **ComPDF** node with operation **Get Task Information**
5. Pass the `taskId` from step 3 — the node automatically polls until the task completes (up to 10 retries, 5s intervals)

### Parameters

- **Execute Type URL** — Required for operations like PDF to Others, Others to PDF, etc. Specifies the exact conversion endpoint path.
- **Binary Property** — Name of the input binary property containing the file (default: `data`).
- **Parameter** — Processing parameter for the API request (format specific, see [ComPDF API docs](https://api.compdf.com/)).
- **Language** — Language setting for OCR and text recognition (default: `2`).
